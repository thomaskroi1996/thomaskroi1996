My name is Thomas Kroißenbrunner and I love programming! I first started to get into it as a teenager, and then used it every now and then throughout my Master's studies in Physics at the Technical University of Graz, in Austria. After graduating I got 2 jobs as a research assistant, which both relied heavily on programming. Ever since then I wanted to deepen my knowledge of different languages. I have been working in the fields of Climate Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I learned statistical methods as well as algorithms for managing, processing and analysing big chunks of data.

I am always on the lookout for making new contributions/learning new technologies, so if you want any help on your project, let me know! 

Here are some of the projects I worked on: <br>

<a href="https://gitlab.com/openCFS/cfs">openCFS</href><br>
<a href="https://github.com/precice/precice">preCICE</href><br>
<a href="https://github.com/thomaskroi1996/openfoam-adapter">openFoam adapter for preCICE</href><br>

Additionally you can find some experiments and projects I coded in my freetime. Some work, some not, but they were always a really great way to learn for me. <br>

One big goal of mine is to deepen my knowledge of C++, and if possible, work in the field as a software engineer. 
Currently also grinding my way through Leetcode, which is a lot of fun!
