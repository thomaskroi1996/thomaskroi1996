My name is Thomas Kroißenbrunner and I love programming! I first started to get into it as a teenager, and then used it every now and then throught my Master's studies in Physics at the Technical University of Graz, in Austria. After graduating I got 2 jobs as a research assistant, which both relied heavily on programming. Ever since then I wanted to deepen my knowledge of different languages. I have been working in the fields of Climate Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics, where I learned statistical methods as well as algorithms for managing, processing and analysing big chunks of data.

Here are some of the projects I worked on: <br>
